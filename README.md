## Power_Consumption_Time_Series_Analysis_Using_Deep_Learning
This project will solve the problem to predict theÂ household electric power consumption using RNN Deep Learning
I did preprocessed all the time series data i.e cleansing and normalization, then analyse it using different graphs and charts and finally develop a Recurrent Neural Network model of Deep Learning and got 0.4 error rate using Tensorflow and Keras
